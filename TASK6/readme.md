# TRAFFIC LIGHT CONTROLLER
## OVERVIEW
This project makes use of LED lights for indication purpose and a VSD Squadron Mini development board is used for auto changing of signal at specified range of time interval. LED lights gets automatically turns on and off by making corresponding port pin of the board “HIGH”. The main objective of this traffic light controller is to provide sophisticated control and coordination to confirm that traffic moves as smoothly and safely as possible.

## COMPONENTS REQUIRED
   ```
   1. VSD Squadron Mini Board

   2. LEDs (3): Depicting red yellow and green light

   3. Jumper wires

   4. Breadboard

   5. Platform IO

   6. VS Code for software development
   ```

## HARDWARE CONNECTIONS
 LED Connections: 
   * Positive end (Anode) connected to GPIO Pin 6 of VSDSquadron Mini.
   * Positive end (Anode) connected to GPIO Pin 5 of VSDSquadron Mini.
   * Positive end (Anode) connected to GPIO Pin 4 of VSDSquadron Mini.
